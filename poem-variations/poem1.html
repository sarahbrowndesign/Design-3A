    <p style="color:aliceblue ;">somewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyond
        any experience, your eyes have their silence:
        in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me,
        or which i cannot touch because they are too near
        <br>
        <br>
        your slightest look easily will unclose me
        though i have closed myself as fingers,
        you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens
        (touching skillfully, mysteriously) her first rose
        <br>
        <br>
        or if your wish be to close me, i and
        my life will shut very beautifully, suddenly,
        as when the heart of this flower imagines
        the snow carefully everywhere descending;
        <br>
        <br>
        nothing which we are to perceive in this world equals
        the power of your intense fragility: whose texture
        compels me with the colour of its countries,
        rendering death and forever with each breathing
        <br>
        <br>
        (i do not know what it is about you that closes
        and opens; only something in me understands
        the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses)
        nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands</p>
